You are an expert in MLOps, real-time data streaming, interactive dashboard development, and chatbot integration using fully open source tools. Your task is to generate a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan for a project titled "Real-Time Financial Data Analytics and Anomaly Detection" using the Finnhub API. The plan must be comprehensive, context-optimized, and self-contained, addressing every instruction without omission.

Project Requirements:

Project Title:
Real-Time Financial Data Analytics and Anomaly Detection

Objective:
Build a live, interactive system that:

Ingests real-time financial data (stocks, forex, cryptocurrency) from Finnhub’s free tier API, including market prices, news, and fundamental data.

Processes and stores this data using a real-time streaming pipeline.

Trains an anomaly detection or trend prediction model on the historical financial data.

Deploys the model as a live prediction API.

Provides an interactive dashboard that displays real-time financial analytics and visualizations.

Includes a clear, accessible link or button within the dashboard that opens an interactive chatbot which explains project details and answers queries.

Uses completely free and open source tools and hosting options.

Tech Stack (Fully Open Source):

Data Ingestion:

Apache Kafka

Finnhub API (for real-time stock, forex, and cryptocurrency data, plus news and fundamentals)

Data Processing:

Apache Spark (Structured Streaming)

Delta Lake

Model Training & Tracking:

MLflow

Scikit-learn or PySpark MLlib (for anomaly detection or trend analysis)

Model Deployment:

MLflow Model Serving or FastAPI

Dashboard:

Plotly Dash or Apache Superset

Chatbot:

Rasa (or ChatterBot for a simpler solution)

Containerization & CI/CD:

Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions or Jenkins, Apache Airflow

Monitoring & Logging:

Prometheus, Grafana

Hosting:

Use Hugging Face Spaces for the dashboard

Use Heroku Free Tier (or similar) for the chatbot

Detailed Implementation Plan:

Data Ingestion:

Step 1.1: Use the Finnhub API as the primary data source:

Query real-time stock, forex, and cryptocurrency data.

Retrieve additional information such as news and fundamental data.

Step 1.2: Write a Python Kafka Producer that:

Periodically calls the Finnhub API.

Parses the JSON responses to extract relevant details (ticker, price, volume, news, fundamentals, etc.).

Publishes each record to a Kafka topic (e.g., financial-data).

Implements a delay between calls to simulate continuous data streaming.

Data Processing:

Step 2.1: Configure Apache Spark Structured Streaming to consume data from the Kafka topic.

Step 2.2: Perform real-time data transformations:

Filter by asset type (stocks, forex, crypto) or news categories.

Aggregate data over time windows (e.g., minute-by-minute, hourly).

Compute summary statistics and identify anomalies or trends.

Step 2.3: Store the processed data in Delta Lake to maintain a historical dataset for training and analysis.

Model Training & Experiment Tracking:

Step 3.1: Develop an anomaly detection or trend prediction model using Scikit-learn or PySpark MLlib.

Step 3.2: Train the model on historical data stored in Delta Lake.

Step 3.3: Use MLflow to:

Log experiments, parameters, metrics, and the trained model.

Provide a sample code snippet:

python
Copy
Edit
import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import pandas as pd

mlflow.sklearn.autolog()

def train_financial_anomaly_detector(X_train):
    model = IsolationForest(n_estimators=100, contamination=0.05)
    model.fit(X_train)
    return model

# Assume X_train is loaded from Delta Lake financial data
with mlflow.start_run():
    model = train_financial_anomaly_detector(X_train)
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "financial_anomaly_model")
Model Deployment:

Step 4.1: Deploy the trained model as a live API:

Option A: Serve using MLflow Model Serving:

bash
Copy
Edit
mlflow models serve -m runs:/<RUN_ID>/financial_anomaly_model -p 5000
Option B: Create a FastAPI application to load the model and expose a /predict endpoint:

python
Copy
Edit
from fastapi import FastAPI
import mlflow.pyfunc

app = FastAPI()
model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model("runs:/<RUN_ID>/financial_anomaly_model")

@app.post("/predict")
async def predict(data: dict):
    prediction = model.predict([data["features"]])
    return {"anomaly_score": prediction.tolist()}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
Interactive Dashboard:

Step 5.1: Develop an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash.

Step 5.2: Design the dashboard to:

Display real-time financial data visualizations (e.g., line charts, bar graphs, heatmaps).

Provide interactive filters (dropdowns, sliders, date pickers) to refine data views by asset type or time window.

Step 5.3: Include a clearly visible link or button on the dashboard that opens the chatbot interface.

Step 5.4: Sample dashboard code:

python
Copy
Edit
import dash
from dash import html, dcc, Input, Output
import plotly.express as px
import requests

app = dash.Dash(__name__)

app.layout = html.Div([
    html.H2("Real-Time Financial Data Dashboard"),
    dcc.Dropdown(
        id='asset-dropdown',
        options=[{'label': asset, 'value': asset} for asset in ['Stocks', 'Forex', 'Crypto']],
        value='Stocks'
    ),
    dcc.Graph(id='financial-graph'),
    html.Br(),
    html.A("Chat with Project Bot", href="https://your-chatbot-hosting-url", target="_blank", style={"font-size": "18px", "color": "blue"})
])

@app.callback(
    Output('financial-graph', 'figure'),
    Input('asset-dropdown', 'value')
)
def update_graph(selected_asset):
    response = requests.post("http://your-model-api-domain:5000/predict", json={"features": [selected_asset]})
    anomaly_score = response.json().get("anomaly_score", [0])
    fig = px.line(x=[selected_asset], y=anomaly_score, title=f"Anomaly Score for {selected_asset}")
    return fig

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8050)
Step 5.5: Host the dashboard on Hugging Face Spaces:

Create an account and a new Space.

Add your app.py and a requirements.txt (include libraries such as dash, plotly, requests).

Once deployed, your dashboard is available at a public URL (e.g., https://your-username.hf.space).

Chatbot Integration:

Step 6.1: Develop an interactive chatbot using Rasa (or a simpler solution like ChatterBot).

Step 6.2: Define intents and responses in the chatbot configuration (focusing on project details, FAQs, and user queries about financial analytics).

Step 6.3: Train and deploy the chatbot:

For Rasa, initialize with rasa init, customize NLU and domain files, train with rasa train, and run using rasa run --enable-api.

Step 6.4: Host the chatbot on a free hosting service (e.g., Heroku Free Tier).

Step 6.5: Ensure the chatbot’s public URL is the one linked from the dashboard.

CI/CD, Containerization, and Monitoring:

Step 7.1: Containerize all components (Kafka producer, Spark streaming jobs, MLflow server, model API, dashboard, chatbot) using Docker.

Step 7.2: Use Docker Compose for local orchestration.

Step 7.3: Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated testing, retraining, and redeployment.

Step 7.4: Implement monitoring:

Use Prometheus to collect key metrics (API response times, Kafka lag, Spark performance).

Visualize these metrics using Grafana.

Ensure structured logging is implemented across all components.

Final Outcome:

A complete MLOps pipeline that ingests live financial data from Finnhub’s free API.

Real-time processing and storage using Apache Spark and Delta Lake.

An anomaly detection (or trend prediction) model trained and tracked with MLflow.

The model deployed as a live prediction API using MLflow Serving or FastAPI.

An interactive Plotly Dash dashboard hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, displaying real-time financial analytics with interactive filters.

A clearly visible link on the dashboard that opens an interactive chatbot (hosted on Heroku Free Tier) for project details and user interaction.

A robust CI/CD, containerization, and monitoring framework ensuring continuous integration, deployment, and performance tracking.
